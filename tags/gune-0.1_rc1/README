README for Gune
---------------

This document describes the Gune installation process.

About:
======
Gune is a C utility library which allows you to program in a more high-level
way.  It contains often-needed functionality which is rewritten time and
again by C programmers.  People keep re-inventing the wheel and each time
this is done, new bugs are created.  This is totally unnecessary and that's
why we've created Gune as a one-stop solution for most widely-used
functionality.

Requirements:
=============

- ANSI C compiler
- BSD Make

The Makefiles assume the C compiler accepts -D and -I options for defining
preprocessor variables and include paths, respectively.  If your BSD Make
uses lint, it is assumed lint accepts -I options as well.
(If you have GCC and xlint, you don't have to worry about it)


Quick installation:
===================

$ make
$ su root
# make install


Changing installation prefix:
=============================

Gune will install to /usr/local by default.  You can change this by
modifying Makefile.inc (see below), or you can override the PREFIX
variable when running make:

$ make
$ su root
# make PREFIX=/usr/mypath install


Compile-time options:
=====================

For those who wish to configure some options, there is the file Makefile.inc
in the project's root directory.

Open it with your favorite text editor and uncomment the lines according to
the instructions in that file.  When you're done, you can follow the steps
outlined in the `Quick installation' section.

If you have built Gune before modifying Makefile.inc, you will want to type
$ make clean
first, and then rebuild according to the steps in `Quick installation'.


Developers:
===========

If you want to submit patches or other code, please check out the subversion
repository.  Information on how to do this is on the Gune website:
