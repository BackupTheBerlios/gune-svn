# TODO items are prefixed "- " and indented with three spaces if the lines
# are any longer than 80 characters.

- Think about thread safety (like locking lists when adding/removing).
- Test implementation of queues and write test harness for it.
- Check out if there's a way to detect if the compiler supports -ansi -pedantic
   -Wall -Werror flags.
- Write something for associative arrays
- Add checks for when malloc fails!!!
- Bounds checking necessary?  If yes, error messages necessary or just NULL?

- Have a look at http://www.eterna.com.au/bozohttpd, they do not use configure.
   They use BSD Make only, like we do.  Look at how it does installation and
   handles non-NetBSD OSes.
