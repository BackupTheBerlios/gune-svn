#
- Think about thread safety (like locking lists when adding/removing).
- Test implementation of queues and write test harness for it.
- Test doubly linked lists.  These have had no usage and almost no testing.
- Bounds checking necessary?  If yes, error messages necessary or just NULL?
- Should we change array_size to array_count???  Or just #define it?
- Do a thorough audit for Doxygen documentation consistency and completeness.
- Think about whether it is bad for alists to have a FILO order when using the
    walk function.
- Add conversion functions between the different types.
- Add sorting functions for the types on which it is meaningful.
- Implement a tree data type.
- Fix installation and check if it works with pkgsrc or can be cleaner, perhaps.
