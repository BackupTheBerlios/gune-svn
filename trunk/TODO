# TODO items are prefixed "- " and indented with three spaces if the lines

- Think about thread safety (like locking lists when adding/removing).
- Bounds checking necessary?  If yes, error messages necessary or just NULL?
- Should we change array_size to array_count???  Or just #define it?
- Think about whether it is bad for alists to have a FILO order when using the
    walk function.
- Add conversion functions between the different types.
- Add sorting functions for the types on which it is meaningful.
- Implement a tree data type.
- Find out how to get Doxygen /not/ to make a hyperlink to <gune/string.h>
   wherever we #include <string.h>
- Find out if it is possible to make a macro or something for errno values
   lists for Doxygen.  These things always look the same, so it should be
   possible if Doxygen supports it.
